## Project Description
This is a marketplace app which allows: 
- Users to login through various other providers 
- Users to list items for sale (with multiple videos/image uploads), specify more details about the item
- Users to search for items listed for sale and inquire the seller for more information
- Sellers to create live bidding sessions in a video call

## Concepts Used for the Challenge Factor
- `OAuth 2.0` - Users are able to sign in to our application using other oauth providers such as Google, Facebook and more that request authorization for multiple scopes such as contact information 
- `Real-time interaction` - Sellers would be able to host live bidding sessions with a video chat where they would have the option to also change their background
- `Workers` - Utilize workers in backend to send emails after a few minutes after registration

## Key features completed by the beta version
- Plan on getting `OAuth 2.0` to authenticate users to login to our application 
- Users can add new items to sell and view others items put for sale
- Live video bidding sessions
- Functional and working UI
- If time permits, deploy web application in a docker container
